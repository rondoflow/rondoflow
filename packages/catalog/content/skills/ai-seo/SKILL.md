# AI SEO

You are an expert in AI search optimization — the practice of making content discoverable, extractable, and citable by AI systems including Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot. Your goal is to help users get their content cited as a source in AI-generated answers.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Current AI Visibility
- Do you know if your brand appears in AI-generated answers today?
- Have you checked ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews for your key queries?
- What queries matter most to your business?

### 2. Content & Domain
- What type of content do you produce? (Blog, docs, comparisons, product pages)
- What's your domain authority / traditional SEO strength?
- Do you have existing structured data (schema markup)?

### 3. Goals
- Get cited as a source in AI answers?
- Appear in Google AI Overviews for specific queries?
- Compete with specific brands already getting cited?
- Optimize existing content or create new AI-optimized content?

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Who are your top competitors in AI search results?
- Are they being cited where you're not?

## How AI Search Works

### The AI Search Landscape

| Platform | How It Works | Source Selection |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Summarizes top-ranking pages | Strong correlation with traditional rankings |
| **ChatGPT (with search)** | Searches web, cites sources | Draws from wider range, not just top-ranked |
| **Perplexity** | Always cites sources with links | Favors authoritative, recent, well-structured content |
| **Gemini** | Google's AI assistant | Pulls from Google index + Knowledge Graph |
| **Copilot** | Bing-powered AI search | Bing index + authoritative sources |
| **Claude** | Brave Search (when enabled) | Training data + Brave search results |

For a deep dive on how each platform selects sources and what to optimize per platform, see [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md).

### Key Difference from Traditional SEO

Traditional SEO gets you ranked. AI SEO gets you **cited**.

In traditional search, you need to rank on page 1. In AI search, a well-structured page can get cited even if it ranks on page 2 or 3 — AI systems select sources based on content quality, structure, and relevance, not just rank position.

**Critical stats:**
- AI Overviews appear in ~45% of Google searches
- AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by up to 58%
- Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited via third-party sources than their own domains
- Optimized content gets cited 3x more often than non-optimized
- Statistics and citations boost visibility by 40%+ across queries

### Google's Official Stance vs. Multi-Platform Reality

This is important to read once before doing anything else.

**Google's position** ([AI features optimization guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide)):
> "The best practices for SEO continue to be relevant because our generative AI features on Google Search are rooted in our core Search ranking and quality systems."

Google explicitly says:
- **No special markup or files are required** for AI Overviews or AI Mode
- **Don't chunk content for AI** — write for people, organize with normal headings and paragraphs
- **Don't write separate content for AI** — that risks "scaled content abuse" spam policy
- **Helpful, reliable, people-first content** wins — same E-E-A-T standards as regular Search
- **No AI-specific Search Console reporting** — use standard SEO metrics

**Other AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot) behave differently:**
- They actively reward extractable structure — passages, FAQs, comparison tables, definition blocks
- They parse `llms.txt`, structured pricing pages, and machine-readable files when present
- They cite third-party sources (Reddit, Wikipedia, review sites) more heavily than top-ranked pages

**What this means for the work:**
- The structural patterns in this skill (40–60 word answer blocks, FAQ schema, comparison tables) help **non-Google AI engines** materially. They also don't hurt Google — they're just normal good content organization.
- For Google AI Overviews / AI Mode specifically: optimize for people and core Search, full stop. Strong E-E-A-T, original information, semantic HTML, clean indexability.
- For ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity: layer on the extractable structure + llms.txt + machine-readable files.

When in doubt, default to "write for people, organize for clarity" — that satisfies both camps.

### Query Fan-Out (Google AI Search)

Google's AI features don't just answer the one query a user typed — they generate **concurrent, related queries** under the hood and retrieve results for each.

Google's own example: a user asking "how to fix lawns" triggers fan-out queries about herbicides, chemical-free removal, weed prevention, etc. The AI synthesizes across all of them.

**Implications:**
- Single-page-per-keyword targeting is less effective. Cover the **full topical cluster** so you're retrievable for the fan-out variants too.
- Long-tail intent matters less than topical authority — Google's AI systems understand synonyms and semantic equivalence.
- A page that comprehensively answers a parent topic (with sub-questions covered) will be retrieved more often than narrow per-query pages.

**Action**: when planning content, brainstorm the 5–10 related queries the AI is likely to fan out to and make sure your content (or your site as a whole) covers them.

---

## AI Visibility Audit

Before optimizing, assess your current AI search presence.

### Step 1: Check AI Answers for Your Key Queries

Test 10-20 of your most important queries across platforms:

| Query | Google AI Overview | ChatGPT | Perplexity | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| [query 1] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |
| [query 2] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |

**Query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [product category] for [use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your product category] pricing"

### Step 2: Analyze Citation Patterns

When your competitors get cited and you don't, examine:
- **Content structure** — Is their content more extractable?
- **Authority signals** — Do they have more citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — Is their content more recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — Do they have structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — Are they cited via Wikipedia, Reddit, review sites?

### Step 3: Content Extractability Check

For each priority page, verify:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without surrounding context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Heading structure matches query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

### Step 4: AI Bot Access Check

Verify your robots.txt allows AI crawlers. Each AI platform has its own bot, and blocking it means that platform can't cite you:

- **GPTBot** and **ChatGPT-User** — OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **PerplexityBot** — Perplexity
- **ClaudeBot** and **anthropic-ai** — Anthropic (Claude)
- **Google-Extended** — Google Gemini and AI Overviews
- **Bingbot** — Microsoft Copilot (via Bing)

Check your robots.txt for `Disallow` rules targeting any of these. If you find them blocked, you have a business decision to make: blocking prevents AI training on your content but also prevents citation. One middle ground is blocking training-only crawlers (like **CCBot** from Common Crawl) while allowing the search bots listed above.

See [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md) for the full robots.txt configuration.

## Optimization Strategy

### The Three Pillars

```
1. Structure (make it extractable)
2. Authority (make it citable)
3. Presence (be where AI looks)
```

### Pillar 1: Structure — Make Content Extractable

AI systems extract passages, not pages. Every key claim should work as a standalone statement.

**Content block patterns:**
- **Definition blocks** for "What is X?" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "How to X" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "X vs Y" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ blocks** for common questions
- **Statistic blocks** with cited sources

For detailed templates for each block type, see [references/content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md).

**Structural rules:**
- Lead every section with a direct answer (don't bury it)
- Keep key answer passages to 40-60 words (optimal for snippet extraction)
- Use H2/H3 headings that match how people phrase queries
- Tables beat prose for comparison content
- Numbered lists beat paragraphs for process content
- Each paragraph should convey one clear idea

### Pillar 2: Authority — Make Content Citable

AI systems prefer sources they can trust. Build citation-worthiness.

**The Princeton GEO research** (KDD 2024, studied across Perplexity.ai) ranked 9 optimization methods:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|:---------------:|--------------|
| **Cite sources** | +40% | Add authoritative references with links |
| **Add statistics** | +37% | Include specific numbers with sources |
| **Add quotations** | +30% | Expert quotes with name and title |
| **Authoritative tone** | +25% | Write with demonstrated expertise |
| **Improve clarity** | +20% | Simplify complex concepts |
| **Technical terms** | +18% | Use domain-specific terminology |
| **Unique vocabulary** | +15% | Increase word diversity |
| **Fluency optimization** | +15-30% | Improve readability and flow |
| ~~Keyword stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **Actively hurts AI visibility** |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost. Low-ranking sites benefit even more — up to 115% visibility increase with citations.

**Statistics and data** (+37-40% citation boost)
- Include specific numbers with sources
- Cite original research, not summaries of research
- Add dates to all statistics
- Original data beats aggregated data

**Expert attribution** (+25-30% citation boost)
- Named authors with credentials
- Expert quotes with titles and organizations
- "According to [Source]" framing for claims
- Author bios with relevant expertise

**Freshness signals**
- "Last updated: [date]" prominently displayed
- Regular content refreshes (quarterly minimum for competitive topics)
- Current year references and recent statistics
- Remove or update outdated information

**E-E-A-T alignment**
- First-hand experience demonstrated
- Specific, detailed information (not generic)
- Transparent sourcing and methodology
- Clear author expertise for the topic

### Pillar 3: Presence — Be Where AI Looks

AI systems don't just cite your website — they cite where you appear.

**Third-party sources matter more than your own site:**
- Wikipedia mentions (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations)
- Reddit discussions (1.8% of ChatGPT citations)
- Industry publications and guest posts
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B SaaS)
- YouTube (frequently cited by Google AI Overviews)
- Quora answers

**Actions:**
- Ensure your Wikipedia page is accurate and current
- Participate authentically in Reddit communities
- Get featured in industry roundups and comparison articles
- Maintain updated profiles on relevant review platforms
- Create YouTube content for key how-to queries
- Answer relevant Quora questions with depth

### Machine-Readable Files for AI Agents

> **Google's stance**: not required for AI Overviews or AI Mode. Their guide explicitly says you don't need new markup, AI files, or markdown to appear in generative AI search.
>
> **Why include them anyway**: non-Google AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) and autonomous buying agents do reward extractable structure. The files below help with those engines without harming Google.

AI agents aren't just answering questions — they're becoming buyers. When an AI agent evaluates tools on behalf of a user, it needs structured, parseable information. If your pricing is locked in a JavaScript-rendered page or a "contact sales" wall, agents will skip you and recommend competitors whose information they can actually read.

Add these machine-readable files to your site root:

**`/pricing.md` or `/pricing.txt`** — Structured pricing data for AI agents

```markdown
# Pricing — [Your Product Name]

## Free
- Price: $0/month
- Limits: 100 emails/month, 1 user
- Features: Basic templates, API access

## Pro
- Price: $29/month (billed annually) | $35/month (billed monthly)
- Limits: 10,000 emails/month, 5 users
- Features: Custom domains, analytics, priority support

## Enterprise
- Price: Custom — contact sales@example.com
- Limits: Unlimited emails, unlimited users
- Features: SSO, SLA, dedicated account manager
```

**Why this matters now:**
- AI agents increasingly compare products programmatically before a human ever visits your site
- Opaque pricing gets filtered out of AI-mediated buying journeys
- A simple markdown file is trivially parseable by any LLM — no rendering, no JavaScript, no login walls
- Same principle as `robots.txt` (for crawlers), `llms.txt` (for AI context), and `AGENTS.md` (for agent capabilities)

**Best practices:**
- Use consistent units (monthly vs. annual, per-seat vs. flat)
- Include specific limits and thresholds, not just feature names
- List what's included at each tier, not just what's different
- Keep it updated — stale pricing is worse than no file
- Link to it from your sitemap and main pricing page

**`/llms.txt`** — Context file for AI systems (see [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org))

If you don't have one yet, add an `llms.txt` that gives AI systems a quick overview of what your product does, who it's for, and links to key pages (including your pricing).

**`/okf/` — Open Knowledge Format bundle (Google-backed, v0.1)**

Google [introduced OKF](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) in June 2026 — a markdown spec for representing site content as a directory of cross-linked files with YAML frontmatter, agent-readable without scraping. Built primarily for data-team catalog metadata; the site-readable-by-agents repurposing was popularized by Suganthan Mohanadasan. No confirmed AI-search ranking signal today — treat it as protocol-layer registration like early schema.org. **For the full breakdown, implementation paths (free generator, WordPress plugin, by-hand), hosting guidance, and when to skip, see [references/okf.md](references/okf.md).**

### Schema Markup for AI

Structured data helps AI systems understand your content. Key schemas:

| Content Type | Schema | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Articles/Blog posts | `Article`, `BlogPosting` | Author, date, topic identification |
| How-to content | `HowTo` | Step extraction for process queries |
| FAQs | `FAQPage` | Direct Q&A extraction |
| Products | `Product` | Pricing, features, reviews |
| Comparisons | `ItemList` | Structured comparison data |
| Reviews | `Review`, `AggregateRating` | Trust signals |
| Organization | `Organization` | Entity recognition |

Content with proper schema shows 30-40% higher AI visibility on non-Google AI engines. **Google's note**: structured data is "not required for generative AI search" but is recommended for overall SEO strategy. For implementation, use the **schema** skill.

---

## Agentic Experiences

Beyond AI search engines summarizing content, autonomous agents are starting to access sites directly — clicking, reading, comparing, even buying on behalf of users. Google's guide flags this as an emerging category to plan for.

**How agents access your site:**
- **Visual rendering** — they screenshot/read the page like a user would
- **DOM inspection** — they parse the page's HTML structure
- **Accessibility tree** — they rely on the same semantic information assistive tech uses (labels, roles, landmarks, headings)

**What to do:**
- **Render meaningful content without heavy JS gymnastics** — if the page is blank until 4 frameworks finish loading, agents see blank
- **Semantic HTML** — use `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<button>`, proper heading hierarchy, `alt` text on images
- **Clean accessibility tree** — every interactive element labelled; ARIA used correctly (or not at all when native HTML suffices)
- **Stable selectors / predictable layouts** — agents struggle with sites that re-render every interaction
- **Visible pricing, specs, contact info** — anything an agent would need to make a buying recommendation should be on a public, indexable page (this is where `/pricing.md` and similar files help)

**Emerging — Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP):**
Google references UCP as a forthcoming protocol that will give agents standardized hooks for commerce interactions (catalog discovery, pricing, checkout). Watch for adoption; for now, the structural recommendations above are the precursor.

For ecom and local business specifically, Google highlights:
- **Merchant Center feeds** + **Google Business Profile** for product/service visibility in AI Search
- **Business Agent** for conversational customer engagement (where applicable)

---

## Content Types That Get Cited Most

Not all content is equally citable. Prioritize these formats:

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|-------------|:------------:|----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific details AI can extract |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |
| **Opinion/analysis** | ~10% | Expert perspective, quotable |

**Underperformers for AI citation:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content (harder for AI to parse)

---

## Monitoring AI Visibility

### What to Track

| Metric | What It Measures | How to Check |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AI Overview presence | Do AI Overviews appear for your queries? | Manual check or Semrush/Ahrefs |
| Brand citation rate | How often you're cited in AI answers | AI visibility tools (see below) |
| Share of AI voice | Your citations vs. competitors | Peec AI, Otterly, ZipTie |
| Citation sentiment | How AI describes your brand | Manual review + monitoring tools |
| Source attribution | Which of your pages get cited | Track referral traffic from AI sources |

### AI Visibility Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Coverage | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Otterly AI** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews | Share of AI voice tracking |
| **Peec AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot+ | Multi-platform monitoring at scale |
| **ZipTie** | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity | Brand mention + sentiment tracking |
| **LLMrefs** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini | SEO keyword → AI visibility mapping |

### DIY Monitoring (No Tools)

Monthly manual check:
1. Pick your top 20 queries
2. Run each through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google
3. Record: Are you cited? Who is? What page?
4. Log in a spreadsheet, track month-over-month

### Search Console expectations

Google's guide is explicit: **there is no AI-specific Search Console reporting**. AI Overviews and AI Mode use core Search ranking, so the standard Search Console reports (Performance, Coverage, Core Web Vitals) are still what you measure with for Google. The third-party tools above are the only way to see cross-platform AI citation behavior.

---

## What NOT to Do

Google's guide calls these out explicitly — they hurt across both traditional Search and AI features.

1. **Write separate content "for AI"**. Same content should serve people and AI. Writing variants targeted at AI systems risks the **scaled content abuse spam policy** — Google's words.
2. **Chunk pages into AI-bait fragments**. Google's guide is direct: *"Don't break your content into tiny pieces for AI to better understand it."* Use normal paragraph + heading structure.
3. **Generate at scale for ranking manipulation**. AI-generated content is fine *if* it meets Search Essentials and spam policies. Mass-producing thin variations does not.
4. **Pursue inauthentic mentions**. Don't fabricate citations or bulk-spam Reddit/Wikipedia for AI visibility. Real participation only.
5. **Block AI crawlers if you want citation**. Blocking GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended means those engines literally cannot cite you. Block training-only crawlers (CCBot) if you must, not the search-and-cite ones.
6. **Hide your main content behind JS that doesn't render**. Both core Search and AI agents need to see your content; JS-only rendering loses both audiences.
7. **Skip E-E-A-T fundamentals**. Author identity, first-hand experience, expertise signals, transparent sourcing — Google's guide leans heavily on these for AI features.

## AI SEO by Content Type

For tactical guidance on SaaS product pages, blog content, comparison/alternative pages, documentation, and local/ecom (Google's emphasis on Merchant Center + Business Profile), see [references/content-types.md](references/content-types.md).

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring AI search entirely** — ~45% of Google searches now show AI Overviews, and ChatGPT/Perplexity are growing fast
- **Treating AI SEO as separate from SEO** — Good traditional SEO is the foundation; AI SEO adds structure and authority on top
- **Writing for AI, not humans** — If content reads like it was written to game an algorithm, it won't get cited or convert
- **No freshness signals** — Undated content loses to dated content because AI systems weight recency heavily. Show when content was last updated
- **Gating all content** — AI can't access gated content. Keep your most authoritative content open
- **Ignoring third-party presence** — You may get more AI citations from a Wikipedia mention than from your own blog
- **No structured data** — Schema markup gives AI systems structured context about your content
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unlike traditional SEO where it's just ineffective, keyword stuffing actively reduces AI visibility by 10% (Princeton GEO study)
- **Hiding pricing behind "contact sales" or JS-rendered pages** — AI agents evaluating your product on behalf of buyers can't parse what they can't read. Add a `/pricing.md` file
- **Blocking AI bots** — If GPTBot, PerplexityBot, or ClaudeBot are blocked in robots.txt, those platforms can't cite you
- **Generic content without data** — "We're the best" won't get cited. "Our customers see 3x improvement in [metric]" will
- **Forgetting to monitor** — You can't improve what you don't measure. Check AI visibility monthly at minimum

| `gsc` | Search Console performance data, query tracking |
| `ga4` | Referral traffic from AI sources |

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What are your top 10-20 most important queries?
2. Have you checked if AI answers exist for those queries today?
3. Do you have structured data (schema markup) on your site?
4. What content types do you publish? (Blog, docs, comparisons, etc.)
5. Are competitors being cited by AI where you're not?
6. Do you have a Wikipedia page or presence on review sites?

# AEO and GEO Content Patterns

Reusable content block patterns optimized for answer engines and AI citation.

---

## Contents
- Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Patterns (Definition Block, Step-by-Step Block, Comparison Table Block, Pros and Cons Block, FAQ Block, Listicle Block)
- Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Patterns (Statistic Citation Block, Expert Quote Block, Authoritative Claim Block, Self-Contained Answer Block, Evidence Sandwich Block)
- Domain-Specific GEO Tactics (Technology Content, Health/Medical Content, Financial Content, Legal Content, Business/Marketing Content)
- Voice Search Optimization (Question Formats for Voice, Voice-Optimized Answer Structure)

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Patterns

These patterns help content appear in featured snippets, AI Overviews, voice search results, and answer boxes.

### Definition Block

Use for "What is [X]?" queries.

```markdown
## What is [Term]?

[Term] is [concise 1-sentence definition]. [Expanded 1-2 sentence explanation with key characteristics]. [Brief context on why it matters or how it's used].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## What is Answer Engine Optimization?

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of structuring content so AI-powered systems can easily extract and present it as direct answers to user queries. Unlike traditional SEO that focuses on ranking in search results, AEO optimizes for featured snippets, AI Overviews, and voice assistant responses. This approach has become essential as over 60% of Google searches now end without a click.
```

### Step-by-Step Block

Use for "How to [X]" queries. Optimal for list snippets.

```markdown
## How to [Action/Goal]

[1-sentence overview of the process]

1. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
2. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
3. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
4. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
5. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]

[Optional: Brief note on expected outcome or time estimate]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## How to Optimize Content for Featured Snippets

Earning featured snippets requires strategic formatting and direct answers to search queries.

1. **Identify snippet opportunities**: Use tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to find keywords where competitors have snippets you could capture.
2. **Match the snippet format**: Analyze whether the current snippet is a paragraph, list, or table, and format your content accordingly.
3. **Answer the question directly**: Provide a clear, concise answer (40-60 words for paragraph snippets) immediately after the question heading.
4. **Add supporting context**: Expand on your answer with examples, data, and expert insights in the following paragraphs.
5. **Use proper heading structure**: Place your target question as an H2 or H3, with the answer immediately following.

Most featured snippets appear within 2-4 weeks of publishing well-optimized content.
```

### Comparison Table Block

Use for "[X] vs [Y]" queries. Optimal for table snippets.

```markdown
## [Option A] vs [Option B]: [Brief Descriptor]

| Feature | [Option A] | [Option B] |
|---------|------------|------------|
| [Criteria 1] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 2] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 3] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 4] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| Best For | [Use case] | [Use case] |

**Bottom line**: [1-2 sentence recommendation based on different needs]
```

### Pros and Cons Block

Use for evaluation queries: "Is [X] worth it?", "Should I [X]?"

```markdown
## Advantages and Disadvantages of [Topic]

[1-sentence overview of the evaluation context]

### Pros

- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]

### Cons

- **[Drawback category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Drawback category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Drawback category]**: [Specific explanation]

**Verdict**: [1-2 sentence balanced conclusion with recommendation]
```

### FAQ Block

Use for topic pages with multiple common questions. Essential for FAQ schema.

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Question phrased exactly as users search]?

[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting context in 2-3 additional sentences].

### [Question phrased exactly as users search]?

[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting context in 2-3 additional sentences].

### [Question phrased exactly as users search]?

[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting context in 2-3 additional sentences].
```

**Tips for FAQ questions:**
- Use natural question phrasing ("How do I..." not "How does one...")
- Include question words: what, how, why, when, where, who, which
- Match "People Also Ask" queries from search results
- Keep answers between 50-100 words

### Listicle Block

Use for "Best [X]", "Top [X]", "[Number] ways to [X]" queries.

```markdown
## [Number] Best [Items] for [Goal/Purpose]

[1-2 sentence intro establishing context and selection criteria]

### 1. [Item Name]

[Why it's included in 2-3 sentences with specific benefits]

### 2. [Item Name]

[Why it's included in 2-3 sentences with specific benefits]

### 3. [Item Name]

[Why it's included in 2-3 sentences with specific benefits]
```

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Patterns

These patterns optimize content for citation by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini.

### Statistic Citation Block

Statistics increase AI citation rates by 15-30%. Always include sources.

```markdown
[Claim statement]. According to [Source/Organization], [specific statistic with number and timeframe]. [Context for why this matters].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Mobile optimization is no longer optional for SEO success. According to Google's 2024 Core Web Vitals report, 70% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices, and pages failing mobile usability standards see 24% higher bounce rates. This makes mobile-first indexing a critical ranking factor.
```

### Expert Quote Block

Named expert attribution adds credibility and increases citation likelihood.

```markdown
"[Direct quote from expert]," says [Expert Name], [Title/Role] at [Organization]. [1 sentence of context or interpretation].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
"The shift from keyword-driven search to intent-driven discovery represents the most significant change in SEO since mobile-first indexing," says Rand Fishkin, Co-founder of SparkToro. This perspective highlights why content strategies must evolve beyond traditional keyword optimization.
```

### Authoritative Claim Block

Structure claims for easy AI extraction with clear attribution.

```markdown
[Topic] [verb: is/has/requires/involves] [clear, specific claim]. [Source] [confirms/reports/found] that [supporting evidence]. This [explains/means/suggests] [implication or action].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
E-E-A-T is the cornerstone of Google's content quality evaluation. Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines confirm that trust is the most critical factor, stating that "untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how experienced, expert, or authoritative they may seem." This means content creators must prioritize transparency and accuracy above all other optimization tactics.
```

### Self-Contained Answer Block

Create quotable, standalone statements that AI can extract directly.

```markdown
**[Topic/Question]**: [Complete, self-contained answer that makes sense without additional context. Include specific details, numbers, or examples in 2-3 sentences.]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Ideal blog post length for SEO**: The optimal length for SEO blog posts is 1,500-2,500 words for competitive topics. This range allows comprehensive topic coverage while maintaining reader engagement. HubSpot research shows long-form content earns 77% more backlinks than short articles, directly impacting search rankings.
```

### Evidence Sandwich Block

Structure claims with evidence for maximum credibility.

```markdown
[Opening claim statement].

Evidence supporting this includes:
- [Data point 1 with source]
- [Data point 2 with source]
- [Data point 3 with source]

[Concluding statement connecting evidence to actionable insight].
```

## Domain-Specific GEO Tactics

Different content domains benefit from different authority signals.

### Technology Content
- Emphasize technical precision and correct terminology
- Include version numbers and dates for software/tools
- Reference official documentation
- Add code examples where relevant

### Health/Medical Content
- Cite peer-reviewed studies with publication details
- Include expert credentials (MD, RN, etc.)
- Note study limitations and context
- Add "last reviewed" dates

### Financial Content
- Reference regulatory bodies (SEC, FTC, etc.)
- Include specific numbers with timeframes
- Note that information is educational, not advice
- Cite recognized financial institutions

### Legal Content
- Cite specific laws, statutes, and regulations
- Reference jurisdiction clearly
- Include professional disclaimers
- Note when professional consultation is advised

### Business/Marketing Content
- Include case studies with measurable results
- Reference industry research and reports
- Add percentage changes and timeframes
- Quote recognized thought leaders

---

## Voice Search Optimization

Voice queries are conversational and question-based. Optimize for these patterns:

### Question Formats for Voice
- "What is..."
- "How do I..."
- "Where can I find..."
- "Why does..."
- "When should I..."
- "Who is..."

### Voice-Optimized Answer Structure
- Lead with direct answer (under 30 words ideal)
- Use natural, conversational language
- Avoid jargon unless targeting expert audience
- Include local context where relevant
- Structure for single spoken response

# AI SEO by Content Type

Tactical guidance for optimizing specific content types for AI search citation. These tactics work for non-Google AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot) and don't hurt Google AI Overviews / AI Mode.

For the cross-cutting strategy, see [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

---

## SaaS Product Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "What is [category]?" and "Best [category]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Clear product description in first paragraph (what it does, who it's for)
- Feature comparison tables (you vs. category, not just competitors)
- Specific metrics ("processes 10,000 transactions/sec" not "blazing fast")
- Customer count or social proof with numbers
- Pricing transparency (AI cites pages with visible pricing) — add a `/pricing.md` file so AI agents can parse your plans without rendering your page (see "Machine-Readable Files" in the main skill)
- FAQ section addressing common buyer questions

---

## Blog Content

**Goal:** Get cited as an authoritative source on topics in your space.

**Optimize:**
- One clear target query per post (match heading to query)
- Definition in first paragraph for "What is" queries
- Original data, research, or expert quotes
- "Last updated" date visible
- Author bio with relevant credentials
- Internal links to related product/feature pages

---

## Comparison / Alternative Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "[X] vs [Y]" and "Best [X] alternatives" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Structured comparison tables (not just prose)
- Fair and balanced (AI penalizes obviously biased comparisons)
- Specific criteria with ratings or scores
- Updated pricing and feature data
- Cite the `competitors` skill for building these pages

---

## Documentation / Help Content

**Goal:** Get cited in "How to [X] with [your product]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Step-by-step format with numbered lists
- Code examples where relevant
- HowTo schema markup
- Screenshots with descriptive alt text
- Clear prerequisites and expected outcomes

---

## Local Business / Ecom (Google emphasis)

Google's AI features pull from product feeds and business profiles for local + ecom queries. Optimize:

- **Merchant Center feeds** kept current with accurate inventory, pricing, attributes
- **Google Business Profile** complete with hours, services, photos, posts, Q&A answered
- **Reviews** — recent + sufficient volume; respond to reviews to signal active management
- **Service area schema** for local services
- **Business Agent** (where available) for conversational customer engagement

# Open Knowledge Format (OKF)

Google's v0.1 markdown spec for representing site content as an agent-readable bundle. Introduced on the [Google Cloud blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) on 2026-06-12 and shipped inside Knowledge Catalog.

## What it is

OKF is a directory of cross-linked markdown files. Each file has:

- A YAML frontmatter block (`type` required; `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `timestamp` recommended)
- A standard markdown body
- Standard markdown links to other files in the bundle (which the spec treats as concept relationships)

An optional `index.md` lists the files for progressive disclosure. The bundle can be distributed as a git repo (recommended), a tarball/zip, or a subdirectory of a larger repo.

The [full spec](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/HEAD/okf/SPEC.md) fits on one page. The repo lives under `GoogleCloudPlatform` (the "not an official Google product" disclaimer is Google's standard open-source boilerplate, not a denial — it appears on most of Google's open-source repos including their main AI samples repo).

### A minimal concept file

```markdown
---
type: Article
title: How to Connect the Ahrefs MCP Server to Manus
description: The official MCP servers, why they did not connect, and the fix.
resource: https://yoursite.com/blog/ahrefs-mcp-manus/
tags: [mcp, ahrefs]
---

# How to Connect the Ahrefs MCP Server to Manus

The body of the post, as clean markdown.
```

Add an `index.md` that lists all files so an agent can see the bundle's shape before opening each file, and that is the entire format.

## Honest framing

**Google built OKF for data teams sharing catalog metadata** — BigQuery tables, API endpoints, metrics, playbooks. Most of the spec's examples are data-team artifacts, not blog posts. Google's blog post framing: "improve data sharing" and "standardized documentation" for collaboration across teams.

Pointing OKF at a marketing site is a **clever repurposing** popularized by [Suganthan Mohanadasan](https://suganthan.com/blog/open-knowledge-format/). It's a legitimate use case for the format but not Google's primary one. Frame it accurately when explaining it to founders or marketing teams.

## What it does for AI search today

Nothing immediate. Nothing crawls the web for OKF bundles yet — the spec is weeks old, no AI engine has announced integration, and Knowledge Catalog ingests bundles only for paying enterprise customers' data teams.

Treat OKF as **protocol-layer registration** — the same shape of bet as early `schema.org` adoption was a decade ago. Schema took the better part of ten years to pay off; people who shipped it early are still glad they did.

A secondary benefit that pays off today regardless: **generating the bundle is itself an internal-linking audit**. Suganthan's tool draws every page as a node and every internal link as an edge, so islands and orphans become obvious at a glance.

## Where OKF fits in the agent-readable stack

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sitemap.xml` | Tells a crawler which URLs exist |
| `robots.txt` (with AI bot rules) | Permits or blocks AI crawlers |
| `llms.txt` | Points an agent at the handful of pages you most want read |
| `/pricing.md` | Structured pricing for agent-buyer comparisons |
| **`/okf/` bundle** | Hands over the content itself as cross-linked concepts |
| Schema markup | Per-page structured data (Article, FAQPage, Product, etc.) |

These stack rather than compete. `llms.txt` is a signpost, OKF is the library.

## How to ship one

Three options, ordered by how much effort they take:

### 1. Suganthan's free web tool (recommended for most sites)

[suganthan.com/okf-generator](https://suganthan.com/okf-generator/) — paste a URL or sitemap, crawls up to 100 pages, returns a downloadable bundle. Also draws the resulting page graph so you can spot disconnected pages before publishing.

### 2. WordPress plugin (pending wp.org approval)

Suganthan's plugin (free, GPL, awaiting wp.org approval at time of writing) installs in a minute, serves the bundle at `/okf/`, and rebuilds on every publish or edit so it stays in sync. Direct download link is in [his blog post](https://suganthan.com/blog/open-knowledge-format/). Requires WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+. Read-only — never edits posts or settings.

### 3. By hand

Only practical for a handful of pages. Each post becomes a markdown file with frontmatter that you cross-link manually. Miserable for a whole site.

## Hosting & discovery

Serve the bundle at `yoursite.com/okf/`, starting with `yoursite.com/okf/index.md`:

- **Static hosts / Cloudflare**: drag and drop
- **WordPress**: Suganthan's plugin handles the serving
- **Static sites with custom paths**: upload the directory to `/okf/`
- **Closed platforms (Wix, Squarespace, most page-builders)**: you usually can't serve files at custom paths — skip OKF entirely

After it's serving, add a line to `llms.txt` pointing to the bundle so agents that read `llms.txt` (today) can discover the bundle (later).

## When to skip

- Site is <10 pages — overhead exceeds payoff
- Site is on a closed platform that won't allow custom paths
- You're not maintaining `llms.txt`, schema markup, or other machine-readable files (OKF compounds with those; alone it does nothing)
- You can't budget the 30 minutes a quarter to refresh the bundle as content changes

## What to watch

OKF is v0.1, weeks old. Worth tracking, not worth obsessing over:

- Whether Google announces OKF support in AI Overviews / Knowledge Graph (currently no signal)
- Whether non-Google engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) announce OKF reading
- Whether the spec moves to v1.0 (breaking changes are possible at <1.0)
- Whether Knowledge Catalog adds public ingestion endpoints
- Adoption signals — search GitHub for `okf/index.md` to see who's shipping bundles

# How Each AI Platform Picks Sources

Each AI search platform has its own search index, ranking logic, and content preferences. This guide covers what matters for getting cited on each one.

Sources cited throughout: Princeton GEO study (KDD 2024), SE Ranking domain authority study, ZipTie content-answer fit analysis.

---

## The Fundamentals

Every AI platform shares three baseline requirements:

1. **Your content must be in their index** — Each platform uses a different search backend (Google, Bing, Brave, or their own). If you're not indexed, you can't be cited.
2. **Your content must be crawlable** — AI bots need access via robots.txt. Block the bot, lose the citation.
3. **Your content must be extractable** — AI systems pull passages, not pages. Clear structure and self-contained paragraphs win.

Beyond these basics, each platform weights different signals. Here's what matters and where.

---

## Google AI Overviews

Google AI Overviews pull from Google's own index and lean heavily on E-E-A-T signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). They appear in roughly 45% of Google searches.

**What makes Google AI Overviews different:** They already have your traditional SEO signals — backlinks, page authority, topical relevance. The additional AI layer adds a preference for content with cited sources and structured data. Research shows that including authoritative citations in your content correlates with a 132% visibility boost, and writing with an authoritative (not salesy) tone adds another 89%.

**Importantly, AI Overviews don't just recycle the traditional Top 10.** Only about 15% of AI Overview sources overlap with conventional organic results. Pages that wouldn't crack page 1 in traditional search can still get cited if they have strong structured data and clear, extractable answers.

**What to focus on:**
- Schema markup is the single biggest lever — Article, FAQPage, HowTo, and Product schemas give AI Overviews structured context to work with (30-40% visibility boost)
- Build topical authority through content clusters with strong internal linking
- Include named, sourced citations in your content (not just claims)
- Author bios with real credentials matter — E-E-A-T is weighted heavily
- Get into Google's Knowledge Graph where possible (an accurate Wikipedia entry helps)
- Target "how to" and "what is" query patterns — these trigger AI Overviews most often

**Watch for OKF.** In June 2026 Google introduced the [Open Knowledge Format](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) — a markdown spec for agent-readable site bundles. There is no confirmed signal that AI Overviews factor it in today, but the spec is published, the GitHub repo lives under `GoogleCloudPlatform`, and it ships inside Knowledge Catalog. For protocol-layer "register early" plays, it has the same shape as early schema.org adoption did a decade ago. See **Machine-Readable Files for AI Agents** in the main `SKILL.md` for how to generate and serve a bundle.

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT's web search draws from a Bing-based index. It combines this with its training knowledge to generate answers, then cites the web sources it relied on.

**What makes ChatGPT different:** Domain authority matters more here than on other AI platforms. An SE Ranking analysis of 129,000 domains found that authority and credibility signals account for roughly 40% of what determines citation, with content quality at about 35% and platform trust at 25%. Sites with very high referring domain counts (350K+) average 8.4 citations per response, while sites with slightly lower trust scores (91-96 vs 97-100) drop from 8.4 to 6 citations.

**Freshness is a major differentiator.** Content updated within the last 30 days gets cited about 3.2x more often than older content. ChatGPT clearly favors recent information.

**The most important signal is content-answer fit** — a ZipTie analysis of 400,000 pages found that how well your content's style and structure matches ChatGPT's own response format accounts for about 55% of citation likelihood. This is far more important than domain authority (12%) or on-page structure (14%) alone. Write the way ChatGPT would answer the question, and you're more likely to be the source it cites.

**Where ChatGPT looks beyond your site:** Wikipedia accounts for 7.8% of all ChatGPT citations, Reddit for 1.8%, and Forbes for 1.1%. Brand official sites are cited frequently but third-party mentions carry significant weight.

**What to focus on:**
- Invest in backlinks and domain authority — it's the strongest baseline signal
- Update competitive content at least monthly
- Structure your content the way ChatGPT structures its answers (conversational, direct, well-organized)
- Include verifiable statistics with named sources
- Clean heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3) with descriptive headings

---

## Perplexity

Perplexity always cites its sources with clickable links, making it the most transparent AI search platform. It combines its own index with Google's and runs results through multiple reranking passes — initial relevance retrieval, then traditional ranking factor scoring, then ML-based quality evaluation that can discard entire result sets if they don't meet quality thresholds.

**What makes Perplexity different:** It's the most "research-oriented" AI search engine, and its citation behavior reflects that. Perplexity maintains curated lists of authoritative domains (Amazon, GitHub, major academic sites) that get inherent ranking boosts. It uses a time-decay algorithm that evaluates new content quickly, giving fresh publishers a real shot at citation.

**Perplexity has unique content preferences:**
- **FAQ Schema (JSON-LD)** — Pages with FAQ structured data get cited noticeably more often
- **PDF documents** — Publicly accessible PDFs (whitepapers, research reports) are prioritized. If you have authoritative PDF content gated behind a form, consider making a version public.
- **Publishing velocity** — How frequently you publish matters more than keyword targeting
- **Self-contained paragraphs** — Perplexity prefers atomic, semantically complete paragraphs it can extract cleanly

**What to focus on:**
- Allow PerplexityBot in robots.txt
- Implement FAQPage schema on any page with Q&A content
- Host PDF resources publicly (whitepapers, guides, reports)
- Add Article schema with publication and modification timestamps
- Write in clear, self-contained paragraphs that work as standalone answers
- Build deep topical authority in your specific niche

---

## Microsoft Copilot

Copilot is embedded across Microsoft's ecosystem — Edge, Windows, Microsoft 365, and Bing Search. It relies entirely on Bing's index, so if Bing hasn't indexed your content, Copilot can't cite it.

**What makes Copilot different:** The Microsoft ecosystem connection creates unique optimization opportunities. Mentions and content on LinkedIn and GitHub provide ranking boosts that other platforms don't offer. Copilot also puts more weight on page speed — sub-2-second load times are a clear threshold.

**What to focus on:**
- Submit your site to Bing Webmaster Tools (many sites only submit to Google Search Console)
- Use IndexNow protocol for faster indexing of new and updated content
- Optimize page speed to under 2 seconds
- Write clear entity definitions — when your content defines a term or concept, make the definition explicit and extractable
- Build presence on LinkedIn (publish articles, maintain company page) and GitHub if relevant
- Ensure Bingbot has full crawl access

---

## Claude

Claude uses Brave Search as its search backend when web search is enabled — not Google, not Bing. This is a completely different index, which means your Brave Search visibility directly determines whether Claude can find and cite you.

**What makes Claude different:** Claude is extremely selective about what it cites. While it processes enormous amounts of content, its citation rate is very low — it's looking for the most factually accurate, well-sourced content on a given topic. Data-rich content with specific numbers and clear attribution performs significantly better than general-purpose content.

**What to focus on:**
- Verify your content appears in Brave Search results (search for your brand and key terms at search.brave.com)
- Allow ClaudeBot and anthropic-ai user agents in robots.txt
- Maximize factual density — specific numbers, named sources, dated statistics
- Use clear, extractable structure with descriptive headings
- Cite authoritative sources within your content
- Aim to be the most factually accurate source on your topic — Claude rewards precision

---

## Allowing AI Bots in robots.txt

If your robots.txt blocks an AI bot, that platform can't cite your content. Here are the user agents to allow:

```
User-agent: GPTBot           # OpenAI — powers ChatGPT search
User-agent: ChatGPT-User     # ChatGPT browsing mode
User-agent: PerplexityBot    # Perplexity AI search
User-agent: ClaudeBot        # Anthropic Claude
User-agent: anthropic-ai     # Anthropic Claude (alternate)
User-agent: Google-Extended   # Google Gemini and AI Overviews
User-agent: Bingbot          # Microsoft Copilot (via Bing)
Allow: /
```

**Training vs. search:** Some AI bots are used for both model training and search citation. If you want to be cited but don't want your content used for training, your options are limited — GPTBot handles both for OpenAI. However, you can safely block **CCBot** (Common Crawl) without affecting any AI search citations, since it's only used for training dataset collection.

---

## Where to Start

If you're optimizing for AI search for the first time, focus your effort where your audience actually is:

**Start with Google AI Overviews** — They reach the most users (45%+ of Google searches) and you likely already have Google SEO foundations in place. Add schema markup, include cited sources in your content, and strengthen E-E-A-T signals.

**Then address ChatGPT** — It's the most-used standalone AI search tool for tech and business audiences. Focus on freshness (update content monthly), domain authority, and matching your content structure to how ChatGPT formats its responses.

**Then expand to Perplexity** — Especially valuable if your audience includes researchers, early adopters, or tech professionals. Add FAQ schema, publish PDF resources, and write in clear, self-contained paragraphs.

**Copilot and Claude are lower priority** unless your audience skews enterprise/Microsoft (Copilot) or developer/analyst (Claude). But the fundamentals — structured content, cited sources, schema markup — help across all platforms.

**Actions that help everywhere:**
1. Allow all AI bots in robots.txt
2. Implement schema markup (FAQPage, Article, Organization at minimum)
3. Include statistics with named sources in your content
4. Update content regularly — monthly for competitive topics
5. Use clear heading structure (H1 > H2 > H3)
6. Keep page load time under 2 seconds
7. Add author bios with credentials
