description: "Analyzes how value scales with participation — tipping points, lock-in, and winner-take-all dynamics. Use when asked 'do we have network effects', 'when will we hit critical mass', 'why is our competitor hard to displace', 'are we winner-take-all', 'how do we defend our position', 'what's our moat', or when analyzing platforms, marketplaces, or any product where more users make the product better."

# Network: Network Effects

Robert Metcalfe observed in 1980 that the value of a telecommunications network scales with the square of the number of connected users. One fax machine is worthless; two fax machines form one connection; a thousand fax machines form almost half a million connections. This relationship — value growing superlinearly with participation — is now called Metcalfe's Law, and it describes a mechanism that creates some of the most durable competitive positions in the economy.

Network effects are not a single phenomenon. At least four distinct types operate through different mechanisms, have different tipping points, and create different levels of defensibility. Direct network effects: each additional user directly increases value for all other users (messaging apps, social networks, communication protocols). Indirect network effects: growth on one side of a market attracts valuable participants on the complementary side (more buyers attract more sellers; more developers attract more users). Data network effects: more usage generates data that improves the product, which attracts more usage. Local network effects: value depends on connections within a subgraph, not the whole network — so the product tips locally before it tips globally.

The strategic implications are profound and often misread. Tipping points exist below which adoption dies and above which it accelerates toward dominance. Winner-take-all dynamics emerge when the network effect is global, switching costs are high, and there are no structural holes that a challenger could occupy. But many "network effect" businesses are actually winner-take-most — local or niche sub-networks can sustain competitors. The difference between these two structures determines the viable competitive strategy.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Identify the Network Effect Type**
For this product or business, ask: why does each additional user create value? For whom? Through what mechanism? Map against the four types:
- **Direct (same-side):** Users connect to other users; value is in the connections themselves
- **Indirect (cross-side):** Users on one side attract or benefit users on the other side
- **Data:** More usage improves the algorithm, recommendations, or intelligence that serves all users
- **Local:** Value depends on connections within a subgraph; the network tips locally before globally

A business may have multiple network effect types simultaneously. Identify all that are active and their relative strength.

**Framing check:** Confirm the product and the network effect hypothesis before continuing. State what you've identified in one sentence, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I'm reading this as: [one-sentence description of the product and the network effect type(s) you've identified]. Is that right?"
- **Header:** "Framing"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes — proceed** — framing is correct
  - **Adjust** — one element is off; user will correct it before you continue
  - **Reframe** — different situation than read; incorporate the correction before proceeding

**Step 2: Locate the Tipping Point**
The tipping point is the adoption level at which the network effect turns positive — where the product becomes more valuable because of its users than despite its limited user base. Below this point, growth requires subsidy, forcing, or high marketing spend. Above it, growth can become self-sustaining. Estimate:
- What is the minimum viable network size for the core use case to be valuable?
- What is the current adoption relative to that threshold?
- Is adoption trending toward or away from the tipping point?

**Step 3: Assess Current Position**
Where is this product on the adoption curve? Plot against three phases:
- **Pre-tipping:** Below critical mass — product must be pushed; churn is high; value proposition is thin
- **Transition:** Approaching critical mass — growth beginning to self-reinforce; niche communities tipping locally
- **Post-tipping:** Above critical mass — network effects are positive; incumbency advantage growing; switching costs rising

**Before narrowing:** Show the full network effects picture. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I've identified [network effect types] and assessed the current position as [pre/transition/post-tipping]. Before I focus, are you most interested in: understanding the tipping point and how to reach it, the defensibility of the current position, or the competitive dynamics with challengers?"
- **Header:** "Focus"
- **Options:**
  - **Reaching critical mass** — tipping point analysis and adoption strategies
  - **Defending the moat** — how durable is the current position, and what threatens it?
  - **Competitive dynamics** — winner-take-all vs. winner-take-most; where challengers can enter
  - **Full picture** — all three angles

**Step 4: Analyze Defensibility**
Not all network effects create equal moats. Assess:
- **Switching costs:** What does a user lose by switching to an alternative? (Connections, history, reputation, integrations)
- **Multi-homing:** Can users participate in multiple networks simultaneously? If yes, the moat is weaker.
- **Global vs. local tipping:** If the network tips locally, challengers can occupy different local clusters.
- **Disintermediation risk:** Can two parties who met on the platform transact off it? If yes, the network effect erodes.

**Step 5: Strategic Implications**
Translate the network effects analysis into strategic choices: if pre-tipping, where to concentrate adoption to tip locally first? If post-tipping, how to raise switching costs and close multi-homing? If a challenger, where are the structural holes the incumbent hasn't filled?

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. State your interpretation of the product, the network effect type, and the strategic question in 1–2 sentences, then ask:

- **Question:** "My read: [your 1–2 sentence interpretation]. How do you want to proceed?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Network effect types, tipping point, defensibility, and strategic implications
  - **Key findings only** — Do these network effects create a durable moat? What is the tipping point?
  - **Competitive focus** — Analyse specifically how a challenger could or couldn't displace this network
  - **Reframe** — The read is off; correct it and the analysis will follow the corrected framing

Proceed based on their selection. If the user reframes, incorporate the correction before running any analysis.

## Notes

Network effects are frequently claimed and rarely real. The test: does adding one more user make the product measurably better for existing users? If the answer is "not really," it's not a network effect — it may be scale economies, brand, or data advantages, which are different (and often weaker) moats. Be honest about the diagnosis.

Metcalfe's Law (value scales with n²) tends to overstate network value at large scales because not all connections are equally valuable — most users have no interest in connecting with most other users. Reed's Law (groups of users create value exponentially) tends to overstate even more. Real-world network values scale sublinearly with n² at large scales. Don't confuse the formula with the mechanism.

Pair with `/network-contagion` to model the adoption spread path and identify where the tipping cascade is likely to begin. Pair with `/strategy-positioning` to translate the network effects moat into a competitive positioning strategy. Pair with `/decision-reversibility-analysis` to assess whether a strategic bet on winning the network effect race is reversible if wrong.
