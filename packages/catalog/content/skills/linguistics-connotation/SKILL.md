description: "Maps the emotional and political freight that words carry beyond their literal meaning. Use when you say 'this word feels wrong', 'what does this term really signal', 'is this word loaded', 'find a better word for this', 'what are the connotations of', 'why does this language feel off', or when word choice is creating unintended reactions."

# Linguistics: Connotation

Words do not just mean. They do.

The gap between denotation (what a word technically refers to) and connotation (what it evokes, who uses it, what it signals about you) is where most communication misfires originate. "Investment" and "expenditure" can describe the same financial transaction, yet one word positions the speaker as forward-looking and the other as cost-focused. "Activist" and "advocate" describe someone who takes public action on a cause; one has acquired associations with disruption and radicalism that the other has not. "Undocumented" and "illegal" describe the same immigration status; their connotative freight determines what policy conclusions feel available.

Steven Pinker's work on the "euphemism treadmill" demonstrates that this is not a solved problem: even carefully chosen neutral terms acquire negative connotations over time as long as the underlying referent carries stigma. The solution is not finding the "right" neutral word but understanding what your current word choices are doing and making deliberate choices about what to activate.

This skill audits word choices for their connotative freight — the emotional register, political associations, in-group signaling, and audience-specific valence of key terms — and finds better alternatives when the current choices are undermining the message.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Identify Key Terms**
Read the text, message, or word list provided. Identify the terms with the highest connotative significance — the words doing the most work beyond their literal meaning. These are usually:
- **Evaluative terms** (words that carry implicit judgment: "streamlined", "bloated", "robust")
- **Category terms** (how you classify people, actions, or situations: "users" vs. "customers" vs. "patients")
- **Action terms** (verbs that carry agency and valence: "decided" vs. "was forced to", "invested" vs. "spent")
- **Metaphors** (which frame a situation in terms of another: "war on X", "X ecosystem", "pipeline")

**Framing check:** Confirm the text and the connotation task before continuing. State what you've identified — the communication being analyzed and the primary connotation concern — in one sentence, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I'm reading this as: [one-sentence framing of what's being audited and what the connotation concern is]. Is that right?"
- **Header:** "Framing"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes — proceed** — framing is correct
  - **Adjust** — one element is off; user will correct it before you continue
  - **Reframe** — different situation than read; incorporate the correction before proceeding

**Step 2: Map Connotative Freight**
For each key term, analyze:
- **Denotation:** What the word technically means
- **Connotation:** What it evokes — emotional register (warm/cold, formal/informal, urgent/calm), political associations, cultural origin, in-group vs. out-group signaling
- **Audience sensitivity:** Which audiences will read the connotation positively, negatively, or not at all
- **Freight type:** Is the freight intrinsic to the word, or has it been acquired through recent usage history? Acquired freight can dissipate; intrinsic freight usually cannot.

**Step 3: Assess the Gap**
Compare the intended message against the connotative freight being carried. Where is the freight:
- **Amplifying** the intended message (the connotation reinforces what you mean)?
- **Undermining** it (the connotation activates associations that conflict with your intent)?
- **Neutral or invisible** to the target audience (the freight is real but not registered)?
- **Exclusive** to a sub-audience (the freight is heavy for one group but not another)?

**Before generating alternatives:** Show the freight map and ask the user to weigh in on which mismatches matter most. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I've identified [N] terms where the connotative freight may be working against you. Before I generate alternatives, which of these matters most — or are there specific audiences whose reading concerns you?"
- **Header:** "Priority"
- **Options:**
  - **Address all mismatches** — full replacement candidates for everything flagged
  - **Focus on [specific term]** — user will name the term that matters most
  - **Focus on a specific audience** — user will name the audience; calibrate recommendations to them
  - **Proceed as assessed** — your read on priority looks right

**Step 4: Generate Replacement Candidates**
For terms where the freight is undermining the message, generate replacement candidates. For each candidate:
- Name the alternative
- Describe its connotative freight
- Note what it gains and what it costs
- Flag any new freight the alternative introduces (the euphemism treadmill problem: replacements can quickly acquire the same negative connotations as the words they replace)

**Step 5: Assess Consistency**
Scan for connotative inconsistency across the text: a formal register disrupted by colloquial terms, a compassionate framing undercut by clinical language, a bold claim softened by hedging vocabulary. Consistency of connotative register is as important as individual word choices.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. State your interpretation of the situation in 1–2 sentences, then ask:

- **Question:** "My read: [your 1–2 sentence interpretation of what's being audited and what kind of connotation problem is in play]. How do you want to proceed?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full audit** — Complete all steps, all key terms mapped with replacement candidates
  - **Key mismatches only** — Flag the most consequential freight mismatches and top replacements
  - **Specific term** — Deep dive on one term or phrase
  - **Reframe** — The read is off; correct it and the audit will follow the corrected framing

Proceed based on their selection. If the user reframes, incorporate the correction before running any analysis.

## Output Format

**Connotation Audit**

| Term | Denotation | Connotation | Freight type | Audience sensitivity | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

Assessment key: Amplifying / Undermining / Neutral / Audience-specific

**Replacement Candidates**
For each term flagged as Undermining or Audience-specific:

- **Current term:** [term] — [why it's problematic]
- **Candidate 1:** [term] — freight: [description] — gains: [what] — costs: [what]
- **Candidate 2:** [term] — freight: [description] — gains: [what] — costs: [what]
- **Recommendation:** [preferred candidate and reasoning]

**Register Consistency Assessment**
Overall connotative register: [description]. Inconsistencies flagged: [list].

## Notes

Connotation analysis is not about finding "safe" or "neutral" language. Neutral language often carries its own freight — clinical distance can signal coldness, bureaucratic language can signal evasion, corporate language can signal inauthenticity. The goal is alignment: making your connotative register serve your communicative purpose.

Pinker's euphemism treadmill warns against chasing neutrality: the problem is often not the word but the underlying referent. If the referent carries stigma or difficulty, the replacement will eventually inherit the same freight. This matters for long-term terminology strategy: sustainable term change requires changing the underlying perception, not just the word.

Pair with `/linguistics-framing` when the problem is larger than individual words — when the entire conceptual frame is wrong. Pair with `/communication-clarity-audit` when the issue is comprehension and ambiguity rather than connotation and valence.
