# Systems Emergence Detection

Emergent properties are the most important features of complex systems and the least designed for. They arise from interactions between components, not from the components themselves — which is why fixing individual parts often fails to fix system-level problems. Identifying emergence requires asking not what each component does, but what arises when they interact.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the System-Level Property**
Name the property to explain or design for. Be precise: "the platform feels trustworthy", "the team produces poor decisions", "the market self-corrects". Vague properties produce vague analysis.

**Framing check:** Confirm the specific system and emergent property before continuing. State what you've identified — the actual system being analyzed and the property you are tracing — in one sentence, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I'm reading this as: [your one-sentence framing of the system and the emergent property in focus]. Is that right?"
- **Header:** "Framing"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes — proceed** — framing is correct
  - **Adjust** — one element is off; user will correct it before you continue
  - **Reframe** — different situation than read; incorporate the correction before proceeding

**Step 2: List Components**
Enumerate the system's components — people, subsystems, rules, technologies, incentives. These are the parts whose interactions you will examine.

**Step 3: Test Each Component**
For each component: does the property exist in it alone? If trust cannot exist in a single user, the property is emergent. This step confirms emergence and rules out simple aggregation.

**Step 4: Trace the Producing Interactions**
Identify the specific interactions between components that generate the property. Show the full set of candidate interactions before narrowing.

**Before narrowing:** Show the complete set of interactions identified to the user first. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I've identified [N] candidate interactions. Before I select the ones most necessary and sufficient for producing the property, are there any you'd flag as especially important, or any I've missed?"
- **Header:** "Prioritise"
- **Options:**
  - **Proceed with your selection** — the set looks right
  - **Flag one** — user will name a specific interaction to include
  - **Add a missing one** — user will describe it

Not all interactions contribute equally — find the ones that are necessary and sufficient.

**Step 5: Assess Desirability**
Is this emergent property desirable? If yes: which interactions need protection from being disrupted? If no: which specific interactions need changing — not which components need replacing.

**Step 6: Identify Intervention Points**
If the emergence is undesirable, locate where in the interaction chain the property can be interrupted or redirected with minimum disruption to desirable emergent properties.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. State your interpretation of the situation in 1–2 sentences — what is being analyzed and what the core question is — then ask:

- **Question:** "My read: [your 1–2 sentence interpretation]. How do you want to proceed?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Emergence sources only** — Where unexpected behavior is coming from, skip implications
  - **Reframe** — The read is off; correct it and the analysis will follow the corrected framing

Proceed based on their selection. If the user reframes, incorporate the correction before running any analysis.

## Output Format

**System-Level Property:** [precise statement]

**Emergence Table**

| Property | Present in Components Alone? | Producing Interactions | Desirable? |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| | | | |

**Key Producing Interactions:** [the 2–3 interactions most responsible for the property]

**Intervention Points (if undesirable):** [where to change interactions, not components]

## Notes

Removing a component to fix an emergent property rarely works — the interaction pattern will reproduce the property with whatever components remain. Target the interaction, not the part.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Emergent properties detected. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/systems-leverage-analysis` — Find leverage in the emergent properties
  - `/systems-feedback-mapping` — Map feedback loops creating the emergence
  - `/strategy-positioning` — Position relative to the emergent dynamics
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
