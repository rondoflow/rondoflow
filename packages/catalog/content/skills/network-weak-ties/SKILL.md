description: "Maps bridging connections across structural holes — the counterintuitive power of loose connections. Use when asked 'where are the silos', 'why are we missing information', 'how do I find opportunities', 'who are the connectors', 'why are teams not collaborating', 'what bridges are missing', or when the question involves information flow, cross-functional collaboration, or network position as a competitive advantage."

# Network: Weak Ties

In 1973, Mark Granovetter published one of sociology's most-cited papers: "The Strength of Weak Ties." The central finding was counterintuitive then and remains counterintuitive now. The connections that deliver the most valuable information — job opportunities, novel ideas, access to resources outside your immediate world — almost never come from your close friends. They come from acquaintances. People you barely know.

The reason is structural. Your strong ties — people you interact with frequently, trust deeply, share history with — are almost certainly embedded in the same clusters you are. They know what you know. They've seen what you've seen. Their information overlaps almost entirely with yours. Weak ties, by contrast, are links between different clusters. Your acquaintance at the conference, your former colleague now in a different industry, your one contact at a competitor — they live in social worlds you don't inhabit. Their information is genuinely different from yours.

Ronald Burt extended Granovetter's insight with structural hole theory. A structural hole is a gap in the network — a position where two clusters are connected only through one person, or not at all. The person who spans a structural hole is a broker. Brokers see information earlier, can translate between worlds, and can combine ideas from separate domains in ways that people embedded in either cluster cannot. Burt found that people occupying structural holes had better ideas (as rated by independent judges), got promoted faster, and earned more. The information and control benefits of bridging structural holes are substantial and measurable.

The implication for organisations, individuals, and strategy: the most valuable position in a network is often not the most connected one — it is the one that bridges the most structural holes.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Map the Clusters**
Identify the distinct clusters in the network — groups with dense internal connections and sparse external ones. These might be teams, departments, professional communities, social groups, or geographic regions. What defines membership in each cluster? What do members of each cluster share (shared work, shared context, shared identity)?

**Framing check:** Confirm the network and the cluster structure before continuing. State what you've identified in one sentence, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I'm reading this as: [one-sentence description of the network, the clusters you can identify, and the question about bridging connections]. Is that right?"
- **Header:** "Framing"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes — proceed** — framing is correct
  - **Adjust** — one element is off; user will correct it before you continue
  - **Reframe** — different situation than read; incorporate the correction before proceeding

**Step 2: Identify Structural Holes**
For each pair of clusters: is there a bridge between them? If so, how many bridges, and who are they? A structural hole exists when:
- Two clusters have no direct connection (pure hole)
- Two clusters are connected through only one person (single-point bridge — high leverage, high fragility)
- Two clusters are connected through many people with the same profile (redundant bridges — low information diversity)

Rate the importance of each structural hole: how valuable would better information flow between these clusters be? What decisions, opportunities, or risks cross this gap?

**Step 3: Assess Current Bridges**
For each person currently spanning a structural hole: how robust is their bridging function? Are they actively translating and connecting, or is the tie dormant? What is their capacity — are they already over-bridged and therefore a bottleneck? What happens to the network if this person leaves?

**Before narrowing:** Show the full structural hole map. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I've identified [N] structural holes across [M] cluster pairs. Before I prioritise, are you most interested in: finding where bridges are missing, understanding who the current brokers are and their leverage, or identifying where to build new bridging connections?"
- **Header:** "Focus"
- **Options:**
  - **Missing bridges** — which structural holes most need spanning?
  - **Current brokers** — who are the key bridge people, and how resilient are they?
  - **Build strategy** — where and how should new bridging connections be created?
  - **All three** — complete structural hole analysis

**Step 4: Diagnose the Consequences**
For each significant structural hole: what is not flowing that should be? Ideas not combining? Opportunities not visible to people who could act on them? Risks not being surfaced to people who could mitigate them? Translate the structural gap into its functional consequence.

**Step 5: Recommend Bridge-Building**
Identify the highest-value structural holes to span. For each: who is best positioned to bridge it (already has some ties to both clusters)? What form should the bridge take (formal collaboration, a community of practice, a liaison role, deliberate weak-tie cultivation)? What would activate dormant ties?

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. State your interpretation of the network, the key structural holes, and the question in 1–2 sentences, then ask:

- **Question:** "My read: [your 1–2 sentence interpretation]. How do you want to proceed?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete structural hole map, broker assessment, and bridge recommendations
  - **Key findings only** — The most important gaps and the highest-leverage bridge opportunities
  - **Individual position** — Focus on one person's or team's bridging position and opportunity
  - **Reframe** — The read is off; correct it and the analysis will follow the corrected framing

Proceed based on their selection. If the user reframes, incorporate the correction before running any analysis.

## Output Format

**Cluster Map**
[Distinct clusters identified, their defining characteristics, and internal density]

**Structural Hole Inventory**

| Gap | Clusters Separated | Current Bridges | Bridge Quality | Hole Importance |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| | | | | |

**Current Brokers**
[Who currently spans structural holes, their leverage, their fragility, and their capacity]

**Functional Consequences**

**Bridge Recommendations**
[Prioritised by value of the hole × feasibility of bridging. For each: who could bridge it, how, and at what investment]

## Notes

Structural hole theory is most powerful in knowledge-intensive, innovation-dependent, or opportunity-sensitive environments. In highly standardised operations where information flows need to be consistent and controlled, structural holes may be features rather than bugs — the separation between clusters ensures processes are not contaminated by informal workarounds. Diagnose before intervening.

The most common weak-ties mistake is confusing social distance with weak ties. A person can have hundreds of LinkedIn connections that are all embedded in the same cluster — those are not functional weak ties, regardless of their number. True weak ties bridge clusters. Pair with `/network-centrality` to identify brokers by betweenness centrality. Pair with `/social-coalition-mapping` when the goal is to build a specific coalition across the structural holes.

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Structural holes mapped. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/network-centrality` — Identify brokers by betweenness centrality and see the full centrality picture
  - `/network-contagion` — Model how information or adoption would spread given the current bridge structure
  - `/social-coalition-mapping` — Build a coalition across the structural holes you've identified
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
