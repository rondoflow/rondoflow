# Systems Leverage Analysis

Most interventions target low-leverage parameters — adjusting numbers, tweaking rates — when high-leverage structural points are available and being ignored. Donella Meadows identified 12 places to intervene in a system, ranging from parameters (nearly powerless) to paradigm (most powerful). The reason high-leverage points go unused is that they face the highest resistance; understanding this is part of the analysis.

## Your Process

**Step 1: List Candidate Interventions**
Gather all interventions currently being considered or tried. Include past attempts that failed.

**Framing check:** Confirm the specific system and the interventions in focus before continuing. State what you've identified — the system being analysed and the intervention set you're working with — in one sentence, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I'm reading this as: [your one-sentence framing of the system and the interventions being examined]. Is that right?"
- **Header:** "Framing"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes — proceed** — framing is correct
  - **Adjust** — one element is off; user will correct it before you continue
  - **Reframe** — different situation than read; incorporate the correction before proceeding

**Step 2: Classify by Meadows Hierarchy**
Map each intervention to its leverage level:
- **Low:** numbers/parameters, buffer sizes, flow rates
- **Medium:** feedback loop strength, information flows, rules of the system
- **High:** goals of the system, system structure, paradigm (the beliefs that create the system)

**Step 3: Identify the Default Level**
What level is typically targeted — and why? Understand the political, cognitive, or practical reasons low-leverage points get chosen.

**Step 4: Surface Ignored High-Leverage Points**
**Before narrowing:** Show the complete classified set of interventions from Step 2 to the user first. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question:** "I've identified [N] interventions across the leverage hierarchy. Before I select the highest-leverage options to focus on, are there any you'd flag as especially important, or any I've missed?"
- **Header:** "Prioritise"
- **Options:**
  - **Proceed with your selection** — the set looks right
  - **Flag one** — user will name a specific intervention to include
  - **Add a missing one** — user will describe it

What higher-leverage interventions exist that are not being tried? Trace why they are being avoided (too costly, politically threatening, requires belief change, long time horizon).

**Step 5: Assess Feasibility**
High-leverage points often face disproportionate resistance. For each high-leverage option: what would be required to act on it? Is it feasible given current constraints?

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. State your interpretation of the situation in 1–2 sentences — what is being analyzed and what the core question is — then ask:

- **Question:** "My read: [your 1–2 sentence interpretation]. How do you want to proceed?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Highest leverage point only** — Single best intervention, skip lower-leverage options
  - **Reframe** — The read is off; correct it and the analysis will follow the corrected framing

Proceed based on their selection. If the user reframes, incorporate the correction before running any analysis.

## Output Format

**Intervention Table**

| Intervention | Leverage Level | Leverage Type | Feasibility | Resistance Source |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| | | | | |

**Default Level Being Targeted:** [level + reason]

**Highest-Leverage Feasible Point:** [intervention + why it's higher leverage + what unlocks it]

**Ignored High-Leverage Options:** [what they are + why they're being avoided]

## Notes

High-leverage points are often counterintuitive — pushing harder in the obvious direction can make things worse. Identify any points where the intuitive intervention is actually negative leverage.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Leverage points identified. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/strategy-positioning` — Use leverage points for strategic positioning
  - `/resource-allocation-analysis` — Allocate resources to the highest-leverage points
  - `/decision-premortem-analysis` — Stress-test the assumptions behind leverage estimates
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
