## When to Use

User needs Vue expertise — from Composition API patterns to production optimization. Agent handles reactivity, component design, state management, and performance.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Reactivity patterns | `reactivity.md` |
| Component patterns | `components.md` |
| Composables design | `composables.md` |
| Performance optimization | `performance.md` |

## Composition API Philosophy

- Composition API is not about replacing Options API—it's about better code organization
- Group code by feature, not by option type—related logic stays together
- Extract reusable logic into composables—the main win of Composition API
- `<script setup>` is the recommended syntax—cleaner and better performance

## Reactivity Traps

- `ref` for primitives—access with `.value` in script, auto-unwrapped in template
- `reactive` can't reassign whole object—`state = {...}` breaks reactivity
- Destructuring `reactive` loses reactivity—use `toRefs(state)` to preserve
- Array index assignment reactive in Vue 3—`arr[0] = x` works, unlike Vue 2
- Nested refs unwrap inside reactive—`reactive({count: ref(0)}).count` is number, not ref

## Watch vs Computed

- `computed` for derived state—cached, recalculates only when dependencies change
- `watch` for side effects—when you need to DO something in response to changes
- `computed` should be pure—no side effects, no async
- `watchEffect` for immediate reaction with auto-tracked dependencies

## Watch Traps

- Watching reactive object needs `deep: true`—or watch a getter function
- `watch` is lazy by default—use `immediate: true` for initial run
- Watch callback receives old/new—`watch(source, (newVal, oldVal) => {})`
- `watchEffect` can't access old value—use `watch` if you need old/new comparison
- Stop watchers with returned function—`const stop = watch(...); stop()`

## Props and Emits Traps

- `defineProps` for type-safe props—`defineProps<{ msg: string }>()`
- Props are readonly—don't mutate, emit event to parent
- `defineEmits` for type-safe events—`defineEmits<{ (e: 'update', val: string): void }>()`
- `v-model` is `:modelValue` + `@update:modelValue`—custom v-model with `defineModel()`
- Default value for objects must be factory function—`default: () => ({})`

## Template Ref Traps

- `ref="name"` + `const name = ref(null)`—names must match exactly
- Template refs available after mount—access in `onMounted`, not during setup
- `ref` on component gives component instance—`ref` on element gives DOM element
- Template ref with `v-for` becomes array of refs

## Lifecycle Traps

- `onMounted` for DOM access—component mounted to DOM
- `onUnmounted` for cleanup—subscriptions, timers, event listeners
- `onBeforeMount` runs before DOM insert—rarely needed but exists
- Hooks must be called synchronously in setup—not inside callbacks or conditionals
- Async setup needs `<Suspense>` wrapper

## Provide/Inject Traps

- `provide('key', value)` in parent—`inject('key')` in any descendant
- Reactive if value is ref/reactive—otherwise static snapshot
- Default value: `inject('key', defaultVal)`—third param for factory function
- Symbol keys for type safety—avoid string key collisions

## Vue Router Traps

- `useRoute` for current route—reactive, use in setup
- `useRouter` for navigation—`router.push('/path')`
- Navigation guards: `beforeEach`, `beforeResolve`, `afterEach`—return `false` to cancel
- `<RouterView>` with named views—multiple views per route

## Common Mistakes

- `v-if` vs `v-show`—v-if removes from DOM, v-show toggles display
- Key on `v-for` required—`v-for="item in items" :key="item.id"`
- Event modifiers order matters—`.prevent.stop` vs `.stop.prevent`
- Teleport for modals—`<Teleport to="body">` renders outside component tree
